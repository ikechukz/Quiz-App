Brief Description -
The app is made up of three basic parts; the splash page, the questions page and the result page

The Splash Page -
The splash page contains an ImageView, two TextViews and a Button.The ImageView and TextView are both animmated. The Button is used to launch
the MainActivity page which contains the first question.

The Question Page -
There are six pages with questions in this app. Each subsequent page is linked to the next by the use of an intent.

The Result Page -
This page collects the score data passed from the question pages and displays it in a TextView. It also contains an if statement in its java
class that is used to compare the total score. The result from the comparison is then displayed as a remark on a TextField.
A timer method is also used in the java class to ask the user to play the game againor exit the app.

Special thanks to GOOGLE, ALC and Udacity. They made my dream come true.
